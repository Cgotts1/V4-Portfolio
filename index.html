      <p class="about">
        <br>Currently a UCSD bootcamp student working towards becoming a
        fullstack developer. I have a B.A. in Anthropology as well as a MSc in
        Forensic Anthropology. My goals after completing this course is to
        find a job within the tech industry as a software engineer and then
        later transition into UX research in order to utilize my
        anthropological background. In addition to my passion for learning new
        skills, I have developed a passion for teaching new skills through my
        work experience in the United States K-12 public school system. While
        teaching can be very rewarding, it can also be mentally taxing, so
        classroom management has become an essential tool I rely on daily in
        order to maintain sanity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Below are portfolio's of work that I have accumulated over the past
        few years that share a brief look into my teaching experience, anthropological research done in college, and various web applications I have developed.
