      <p class="about">
        <br>Currently a UCSD bootcamp student working towards becoming a
        fullstack developer. I have a B.A. in Anthropology as well as a MSc in
        Forensic Anthropology. My goals after completing this course is to
        find a job within the tech industry as a software engineer and then
        later transition into UX research in order to utilize my
        anthropological background. In addition to my passion for learning new
        skills, I have developed a passion for teaching new skills through my
        work experience in the United States K-12 public school system. While
        teaching can be very rewarding, it can also be mentally taxing, so
        classroom management has become an essential tool I rely on daily in
        order to maintain sanity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Below is a portfolio of work that I have accumulated over the past
        year with applications focusing on education and anthropology. While I
        believe that these applications provide real world value to those who
        work in education, as well as those who do anthropological field work,
        I think it may benefit anyone who would like to gain insight into
        human behavior and how we learn as a society.
